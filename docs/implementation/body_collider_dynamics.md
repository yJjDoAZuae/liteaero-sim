# Body Collider Dynamics — Implementation Plan

**Scope:** Implements the four decided body-collider improvements in
[body_collider.md §5](../design/body_collider.md): §5a inelastic velocity-arrest normal contact,
§5b restitution-consistent hard constraint, §5c dedicated gear-style rotational-reaction $\Delta\theta$,
and §5d tangential scrape friction (Coulomb + viscous). **All design questions OQ-BC-1…5 are
resolved**, so no open question blocks this plan. OQ-BC-5 fixed the §5a parameterization: the only
user-facing contact knob is the non-dimensional coefficient of restitution `restitution_nd` ($e$,
§5b); the §5a arrest damping is derived internally ($b_\text{total}=m/(N_\text{arr}\,dt)$, fixed
$N_\text{arr}\approx3$) from airframe properties that `Aircraft` now supplies to
`BodyCollider::initialize`, and `CollisionVolumeParams` reduces to geometry.

**Design authority:** [body_collider.md](../design/body_collider.md) (§5a–§5d, Integration,
Serialization), [landing_gear.md §2a, §7](../design/landing_gear.md) (the $\Delta\theta$ pattern and
its stability), [aircraft.md](../design/aircraft.md) (step 5a / step 12 call sites).

**Last updated:** 2026-06-26

## Work Items

| ID | Status | Title | Depends on | Design refs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IP-BC-1 | todo | Add optional `restitution_nd` (default 0) to `BodyColliderParams` JSON + proto + `parse`/`serialize`; existing configs unaffected by the default | — | [body_collider.md §5b](../design/body_collider.md), Serialization |
| IP-BC-2 | todo | Generalize `KinematicState::applyTerrainHardConstraint(pen, restitution_nd)` to remove $(1+e)\,v_z$ instead of hard-zeroing; pass the configured restitution from `Aircraft::step` step 12 | IP-BC-1 | [body_collider.md §5b, §3](../design/body_collider.md) |
| IP-BC-3 | todo | Reduce `CollisionVolumeParams` to geometry — remove `stiffness_npm`/`damping_nspm` (JSON + proto + parse/serialize) — and migrate every `body_collider` config and test fixture | — | [body_collider.md §5a, OQ-BC-5](../design/body_collider.md) |
| IP-BC-4 | todo | Add airframe mass, outer `dt`, and inertia tensor to `BodyCollider::initialize`; derive the aggregate arrest damping $b_\text{total}=m/(N_\text{arr}\,dt)$ (fixed internal $N_\text{arr}\approx3$), distributed across the live penetrating corners | — | [body_collider.md §5a, OQ-BC-5](../design/body_collider.md) |
| IP-BC-5 | todo | Replace the Kelvin–Voigt penalty in `BodyCollider::step` with the velocity-arrest force $F=\max(0,\,c\,\delta\dot\delta)$ (no spring); TDD: inelastic ($e{=}0$) drop tests and $e$-range robustness across the 5 kg / 1045 kg / 5500 kg fixtures | IP-BC-2, IP-BC-3, IP-BC-4 | [body_collider.md §5a](../design/body_collider.md) |
| IP-BC-6 | todo | Add `friction_coulomb_nd` ($\mu$) and `friction_viscous_nd` ($c_t$) to `CollisionVolumeParams` JSON + proto + parse/serialize (default 0 → frictionless until set) | — | [body_collider.md §5d](../design/body_collider.md) |
| IP-BC-7 | blocked (IP-BC-5, IP-BC-6) | Apply the tangential force $-\mu F_\text{pen}\hat{\mathbf v}_{t,\text{reg}} - c_t\mathbf v_t$ at penetrating corners in `BodyCollider::step`, regularized near zero slip | IP-BC-5, IP-BC-6 | [body_collider.md §5d](../design/body_collider.md) |
| IP-BC-8 | todo | Add the §5c dedicated $\Delta\theta$ serialized state (per-axis second-order filter) to `BodyCollider` (JSON + proto + `reset`), and plumb the inertia tensor into `initialize` for the per-axis $\omega_n,\zeta$ sourcing | — | [body_collider.md §5c](../design/body_collider.md), [landing_gear.md §2a](../design/landing_gear.md), Serialization |
| IP-BC-9 | blocked (IP-BC-5, IP-BC-8) | Drive the body-collider $\Delta\theta$ from the contact moment through $H_2$ and sum it into the kinematic attitude in `Aircraft::step`, separately from the gear $\Delta\theta$ | IP-BC-5, IP-BC-8 | [body_collider.md §5c](../design/body_collider.md), [aircraft.md](../design/aircraft.md) |

> **IP-BC-7 blocked reason:** the tangential force scales the Coulomb term by the normal force
> $F_\text{pen}$, which does not exist until IP-BC-5 lands the velocity-arrest normal force; the
> friction config fields (IP-BC-6) must also be present.

> **IP-BC-9 blocked reason:** the rotational reaction is driven by the contact moment produced by the
> new normal (and tangential) force, so IP-BC-5 must land first; the $\Delta\theta$ state and filter
> sourcing (IP-BC-8) must exist to receive it.

## Notes

**Sequencing.** No open questions remain. Natural order: §5b (IP-BC-1 → IP-BC-2) and the §5a
foundation (IP-BC-3 geometry-only struct, IP-BC-4 `initialize` plumbing + derived damping) first, then
IP-BC-5 (the velocity-arrest force, which the inelastic drop test verifies together with the §5b
constraint). §5d (IP-BC-6 → IP-BC-7) and §5c (IP-BC-8 → IP-BC-9) follow once the §5a force/moment
exists.

**§5b is nearly behavior-preserving at $e=0$.** The current `applyTerrainHardConstraint` already zeros
the downward velocity component, which is exactly $(1+e)v_z$ at $e=0$; IP-BC-2 generalizes it to a
configured restitution and makes the constraint the primary, parameterized inelastic mechanism per the
resolved OQ-BC-2.

**Cross-cutting plumbing.** Both IP-BC-4 (mass + `dt`) and IP-BC-8 (inertia tensor) require
`Aircraft` to pass airframe properties into `BodyCollider::initialize`, which is presently
config-only. Coordinate the signature change so it is made once.

**TDD / build.** Every item writes a failing test first. Build and test with the project toolchain:
`PATH="/c/msys64/ucrt64/bin:$PATH" mingw32-make -C build liteaerosim_test liteaero_sim_py` then
`ctest --test-dir build -R "BodyCollider|Aircraft|KinematicState"`.
